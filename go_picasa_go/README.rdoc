=Go Picasa go

Go Picasa go is intended as library written in ruby to manipulate 
Picasa's[http://picasaweb.google.com/] albums and photos in a easy way. The idea
is to provide behaviors to ordinary objects so they can do basic operations 
(CRUD) in a more object oritented way, lefting behind all the HTTP talk that was 
necessary previouly to interect with this service provided by Google.

This library was implemented based on the Protocol Guide
[http://code.google.com/intl/pt-BR/apis/picasaweb/docs/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html] 
version 2.0 of Picasa Web Albums Data API.
 
Go Picasa go is still in development but it will available for use in a short 
period of time.

==Quick Start

In your model:

  class YourAlbum
    act_as_picasa_album

    
    # This method must be implemented so the library knows for what user
    # the album operations will occur

    def user_id
      "username" # From the e-mail: username@gmail.com
    end
  end
  
==Usage

Better to show than to talk. Take a look at the examples below:
To create an album:

  album = YourAlbum.new
  album.title = "Title"
  album.summary = "Summary"
  album.location = "Location"
  album.keywords = "Keyword, another keyword"

  album.save # Returns true or false
  album.save! # Raise exception in case of not being able to save the album

To update that album:

  album.title = "Updating the title"

  album.update # Return true or false
  album.update # Raise exception in case of not being able to update the album

To destroy an album:

  album.destroy # Raise exception incasa of not being able to destroy the album

To retrieve an album

  album = YourAlbum.find user_id, album.id, auth_token
